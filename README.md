# Advanced-Encyrption-Standard-AES-
A C++ program that uses the Advanced Encryption Standard to encrypt and decrypt text files using a 128-bit key size. 
The Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), also known by its original name Rijndael, is a specification for the encryption of electronic data established by the U.S
National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in 2001.

The program was build with accordacnce to the Federal Information Processing Standards Publication #197, Nov. 26, 2001.
The paper can be found at https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/fips/nist.fips.197.pdf.

As of now, the program is not as user-friendly as it could be due to needing to constantly test different function. I will be improving the usability by making it simple to encyrpt user-defined text files and allow for user-defined encryption key input. Once I do that to an adequate level, I will add a simple function documention and 
examples.
